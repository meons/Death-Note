1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. Run `npm install -g bower` command from Git Bash
3. Create .bowerrc file in root of your project with this content `{ "directory": "web/assets/vendor/" }`
4. Run `bower init` command to create bower.json file
5. Run `bower install --save boostrap` command to install boostrap and save it to the bower.json file
6. Don't add web/assets/vendor to your .gitignore file ! Assets need to be commited because Bower currently doesn't have a "lock" feature.
